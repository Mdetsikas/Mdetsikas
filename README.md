## Hey, I'm Mathew 👋

I'm a systems and infrastructure enthusiast with a strong interest in
how production environments are designed, secured, and automated.

My work spans both **professional environments** and a **personal home lab**
where I intentionally experiment, break things, and document what I learn. 
This GitHub serves as a place to document my learning and growth as 
I continue building hands-on infrastructure experience.

---

## Areas of Focus

- Home lab architecture & virtualization
- Network automation and segmentation
- Containerization (Docker)
- Observability and monitoring
- Security-first infrastructure design

---

## Professional Experience (Work Environment)

- 🧩 Kubernetes (k8s)  
  My exposure to Kubernetes comes from a **work environment**, where I interact
  with existing clusters rather than running them as a personal lab.

  This has given me experience with:
  - Understanding cluster architecture and workloads
  - Working within established security and access constraints
  - Supporting services rather than treating Kubernetes as a playground

  I intentionally keep my **personal lab separate** from work infrastructure.

## [Home Lab(Personal Projects)](https://github.com/Mdetsikas/homelab)

My home lab is a **single Proxmox host** built from repurposed gaming PC hardware.
The goal is not raw performance, but **hands-on learning and experimentation**.

### Current Home Lab Focus:
- Proxmox virtualization
- Docker-based services
- Internal-only dashboards and tooling
- Monitoring and observability

### Active Projects:
- 📊 **Internal dashboard** using Grafana
- 📈 **Metrics & monitoring** with Prometheus
- 🐳 **Docker-first deployments** to better understand container lifecycles
- 🧪 Evaluating additional services as the lab grows (logging, alerting, etc.)

Everything is treated as:
- Documented
- Version-controlled
- Replaceable if broken

---

## Lab Philosophy

I treat my home lab like a scaled-down production environment:

- Documentation-first (if it isn’t written down, it doesn’t exist)
- Security by design, even for internal-only services
- Learn fundamentals before scaling complexity
- Break things on purpose, then fix them properly

## Why This GitHub Exists

This GitHub serves as:
- A technical journal of what I’m learning
- A portfolio of real infrastructure work
- A place to document **why** decisions were made, not just **how**
