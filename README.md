## Hey, I'm Mathew 👋

I'm a System Administrator and infrastructure enthusiast with a strong interest in how production environments are designed, secured, and automated.

My work spans both **professional enterprise environments** and a **personal home lab** where I intentionally experiment, break things, and document the repair process. This GitHub serves as a technical journal of my growth as I build hands-on infrastructure experience.

I currently manage the independent IT environment for a standalone Cybersecurity education facility.
- **Scope:** Sole administrator for servers, virtualization, backup, and user support.
- **Key Work:** Managing Windows Server domains, automating user management via PowerShell, and overseeing imaging cycles for 125+ workstations.

**Kubernetes Implementation (Greenfield Deployment)**
I am currently **architecting and building a Kubernetes cluster from the ground up** for the facility.

## 🏠 [Home Lab (Personal Projects)](https://github.com/Mdetsikas/homelab)

My home lab is a **single Proxmox host** built from repurposed hardware. The goal is not raw performance, but **hands-on learning and experimentation**.

### Active Projects:
- 📊 **Internal Dashboard:** Centralized monitoring using Grafana.
- 🐳 **Docker-First Deployments:** Managing self-hosted services to understand container lifecycles.
- 🧪 **Infrastructure Testing:** Evaluating new tools (logging, alerting) before professional implementation.

*Everything in the lab is documented, version-controlled, and designed to be replaceable.*

## Why This GitHub Exists

This GitHub serves as:
- A technical journal of what I’m learning
- A portfolio of real infrastructure work
- A place to document **why** decisions were made, not just **how**
